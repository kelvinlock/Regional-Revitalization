1. 陳銀豪 16 歲國中畢業便離開家鄉，一邊求學一邊工作，之後因產業外移赴中國工作近 20 年，直到 2016 年父母健康惡化才決定回鄉。
   Chen left home at 16 to study and work, later spending ~20 years working in China before returning in 2016 due to his parents’ deteriorating health.

2. 父親同時罹患多種疾病（含兩種癌症與嚴重阿茲海默症），母親長期「病情輕的照顧病情重的」導致身心耗損，促使他結束中國事業，專心返鄉照護。
   His father had multiple illnesses, including two cancers and severe Alzheimer’s, while his mother was exhausted from caregiving, pushing him to quit his job in China and return.

3. 醫師建議藥物之外搭配「園藝治療」延緩失智惡化，他因此購買農地作為治療農場，卻在點交時才發現土地充滿廢棄豬舍、數百公噸收水與掩埋廢棄物，花了兩年才清理完。
   Doctors recommended horticultural therapy alongside medication, so he bought farmland for a therapy farm, only to discover massive waste and abandoned pig houses, taking two years to clean.

4. 毫無農業背景的他白天整理農地、晚上上課，參加農民大學、雲科大有機專班與農委會課程，一邊學習一邊思考適合父親的作物。
   With no farming background, he worked on the land by day and studied farming courses at night, thinking about crops suitable for his father.

5. 他選擇可可樹，因為需要大量修枝，非常適合作為原液治療的工作內容；同時，可可營養成分對失智防治特別有幫助，於是決定在這塊土地上發展可可產業。
   He chose cocoa trees because they require frequent pruning, ideal for horticultural tasks, and cocoa’s nutrition is beneficial for dementia, so he decided to build a cocoa industry there.

6. 曾在日本生活的經驗，讓他親眼看過「消失的城市」，而土庫鎮人口連續 45 年負成長、老化嚴重，讓他擔心有一天家鄉也會變成空城，「我的根會在哪裡」成為他心中的問題。
   Having lived in Japan, he saw “disappearing cities”; with Tuku’s 45 years of negative population growth and severe aging, he worried his hometown might vanish and wondered where his roots would be.

7. 2019 年政府推動地方創生時，保守的土庫鎮幾乎沒有人要提案，他卻以可可產業為核心提出創生構想，希望像咖啡一樣把可可打造成兼具時尚與營養的新興產業，並藉由可可用水量僅為水稻十分之一，回應地層下陷與環境責任。
   In 2019, when the government promoted local revitalization and no one in conservative Tuku wanted to propose projects, he used cocoa as the core industry, aiming to make it a fashionable, nutritious sector like coffee, and to reduce land subsidence since cocoa uses only one-tenth the water of rice.

8. 他對雲林縣政府與土庫鎮公所在地方創生過程中的陪伴與支持深受感動，認為身為土庫人自己更是「責無旁貸」，要為家鄉的未來承擔責任。
   He was deeply moved by the support from Yunlin County Government and Tuku Township Office, and felt a strong responsibility, as a Tuku native, to take ownership of his hometown’s future.
