##【Podcast】重要內容總結

1. 2019 年起，臺灣推動地方創生國家戰略，面對人口外流與城鄉失衡；即使遭遇 COVID-19 衝擊，各地創生團隊仍與社區緊密合作，展現韌性。
   Since 2019, Taiwan’s local revitalization strategy has addressed depopulation and inequality; despite the COVID-19 pandemic, local teams have continued to work closely with communities.

2. 雲林土庫鎮是高齡化嚴重、老街沒落的小鎮，但也是創生案例「土庫藝可可莊園」的舞台。
   Tuku in Yunlin is a town with a heavily aging center and a declining old street, yet it has become the stage for the “Tuku-Yi Cocoa Manor” revitalization case.

3. 創辦人陳銀豪為了照顧失智父親返鄉，買下前身為廢棄養豬場與地下毒場的污染農地，忍痛註銷價值高昂的養豬執照，投入巨額資金整治土地。
   Founder Chen returned home to care for his father, buying polluted land that was once a pig farm and drug site, cancelling a valuable license, and investing heavily in remediation.

4. 他從零開始學農，選擇可可作為作物，結合父親的園藝治療需求與可可對失智、心血管的健康益處，打造全程天然、無添加、成本高但高品質的頂級巧克力。
   Starting from scratch, he chose cocoa for both therapeutic work and its health benefits, creating premium, additive-free chocolate with high production costs.

5. 土庫藝可可莊園採用智慧溫室與 Tree-to-Bar 模式，提供食農教育與觀光體驗，遊客可參與從栽種到製成巧克力的完整流程，園區在假日能吸引上千名遊客。
   The manor uses smart greenhouses and a tree-to-bar model, offering educational and tourism experiences where visitors see the full cocoa process; thousands come on weekends.

6. 透過可可莊園的亮點效應，帶動土庫老街人潮回流，促成返鄉青年與老店二、三代組成商圈協會，串聯農會、觀光工廠、在地品牌，形成完整的觀光產業鏈。
   The cocoa estate’s “flagship effect” draws people back to Tuku Old Street, encouraging youth and shop successors to form a business association and link multiple local brands into a tourism chain.

7. 此案例展示地方創生不只是產業創新，更包括：土地修復、家族照顧、人口返鄉、社區組織與跨世代合作，成為雲林小鎮翻轉與「在地共好」的典型故事。
   This case shows that local revitalization is not only about industry innovation but also land healing, family care, return migration, community organizing, and cross-generational cooperation.
